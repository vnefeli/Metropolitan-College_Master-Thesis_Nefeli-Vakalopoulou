## ABSTRACT
High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) represents the most common and aggressive form of epithelial ovarian cancer, characterized by limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Despite increased immune cell infiltration observed in certain cases, the response to immunotherapies remains low. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that shape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in HGSOC is critical for discovering novel therapeutic targets. In the present study, single-cell RNA-seq data from normal and malignant ovarian cells were analyzed using the scMINER tool, focusing on the differential activity of transcription factors (TFs) and signaling molecules (SIGs). This approach enabled the identification of active transcriptional regulators and the decoding of cellular programs that define the TME in HGSOC. The results revealed strong activation of type I interferon pathways, with overexpression of transcription factors such as STAT1 and IRF7, which are associated with chronic inflammation and the development of an exhausted CD8⁺ phenotype. In parallel, suppression of cytotoxic effector cell activity, including NK and CD8⁺ T cells, was observed, along with enrichment of immunosuppressive pathways and loss of key TFs, confirming the presence of multilayered immunosuppression. Moreover, enrichment in “adipose-like” transcriptional signatures was detected, possibly reflecting the metabolic interaction of the tumor with the adipose tissue of the omentum, which influences immune cell functionality. Further complementary studies using technologies such as spatial transcriptomics, multiparametric fluorescent imaging, and immunometabolomics could elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics and functional states of cells within the TME, thereby contributing to the development of more targeted immunotherapies for HGSOC.
